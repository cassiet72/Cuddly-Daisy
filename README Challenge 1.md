##Benzinga - an financial news information disruptor

## Landscape

* The domain of the company is www.benzinga.com.  It was started during the financial crisis in 2010 as a means to empower individual investors and not rely on a single place for financial media or financial advice, and receive real time news that was actionable from an investment perspective.  The platform was built using React and Redux, both sit on top of Javascript.

* The emergence of more apis from various "major media" outlets and government websites enabled the firm to create a robust financial information platform for individual investors so they did not have to visit multiple websites to get the data they were looking for on a particular investment idea.

* They are considered a disruptor in an industry dominated by Thompson Reuters, xignite, Exchange Data International, Nasdaq Market Data Feeds, and Quandi as well are the top competitors and alternatives to Benzinga.


## Results

* The company has had a major impact in the information and stock market data provider industry which goes beyond an impact on its direct competitors but also has affected the ability of individual investors to do their own research and self investing without needing a broker or advisor.  So there are ripple affects Benzinga has caused that are far reaching and continue.

* The two main core metrics for success for the company are subscription revenues and number of subscribed users.  As a result, the firm was sold since it has over 25 million monthly subscribers.


## Recommendations

* My recommendation to the company would be to take their revenue model a step further and introduce banking and investment services for "home gamers" using defi technology and creating a truly independent alternative to the large dominant online brokerage firms that simply have no trading fees as a means to attract customers and make money of the cash float.

* To implement this strategy the company would have to use the apis from the online open banking as a service firms such as Solidifi since they are built exactly to provide non-bank firms the ability to monetize existing relationships and expand services offered to existing customers and gain more wallet share.
